"""
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that takes in an unsorted list and returns a sorted list in O(n log n) 
time which is faster than many other sorting algorithms that have O(nÂ²) time complexity. It uses a divide 
and conquer approach.

Merge sort works by using a divide and conquer approach: it divides the array into two halves until each
 sublist contains only a single element, then it recursively sorts each sublist, and merges the sorted 
 sublists into a sorted array.

Given the main function merge_sort() below, implement the helper function merge() below. merge() accepts 
two sorted lists left and right and returns a sorted list.
