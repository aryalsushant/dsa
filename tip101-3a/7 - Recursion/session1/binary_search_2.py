"""
Binary search is a searching algorithm that allows us to efficiently find the index of a given value within a 
sorted list. Given the pseudo code for binary search below, implement an iterative (non-recursive) implementation 
of binary search that returns True if the given target is in the list and False otherwise. There is also a recursive 
alternative that weâ€™ll cover in the session 2 problem set!

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your implementation.

    # Initialize a right pointer to the last index in the list
    right = len(lst) - 1
    # While left pointer is less than right pointer:
    while left < right:
        # Find the middle index of the array
        middle = (left + right) // 2
