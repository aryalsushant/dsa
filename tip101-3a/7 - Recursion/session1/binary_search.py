"""
Binary search is a searching algorithm that allows us to efficiently find the index of a given value within a 
sorted list. Given the pseudo code for binary search below, implement an iterative (non-recursive) implementation
 of binary search. There is also a recursive alternative that weâ€™ll cover in the session 2 problem set!

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your implementation.
