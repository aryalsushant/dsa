"""
In poker, players are given a hand of five cards. A player has a "two-pair" hand if they have two cards of 
the same rank and another two cards of another rank. The fifth card isnâ€™t used here.

Given the Card class below, write a function is_two_pair() that takes in a list player_hand that contains 5 Card objects.

The function returns True if the player has a two pair hand and False otherwise.

Cards in the hand are guaranteed to be unique and are guaranteed to have on the following suits and ranks:

The suit is one of the following values: "Hearts", "Spades", "Clubs", "Diamonds"
The rank is one of the following values: '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace'
