If you used a dictionary as part of your solution to max_audience_performances() in the previous problem, 
try reimplementing the function without using a dictionary. If you implemented max_audience_performances() 
without using a dictionary, try solving the problem with a dictionary.

Once you've come up with your second solution, compare the two. Is one solution better than the other? Why or
why not?
